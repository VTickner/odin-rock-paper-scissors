## Process

- Created the basic plan for the game - rules, interface, inputs, outputs
- Created pseudocode to describe how will work
- Created flowchart to show how the game will work
- Created a basic HTML page (initially game will played within the browser developer console)
- Broke the game down into smaller sections to code and then test each part as I went along:
  - Coded initial value setup, get player input, check player input and redo get player input if not a correct option
  - Coded random number (to be used for computer selection)
  - Coded computer selection
  - Coded a comparison to work out who won that round and added a point to the winner's score

TODO

- Refactored the JavaScript to make DRY.
