## Process

- Created the basic plan for the game - rules, interface, inputs, outputs
- Created pseudocode to describe how will work
- Created flowchart to show how the game will work
- Created a basic HTML page (initially game will played within the browser developer console)
- Broke the game down into smaller sections to code and then test each part as I went along:
  - Initial value setup, get player input, check player input and redo get player input if not a correct option
  - Generate random number (to be used for computer selection)
  - Get computer selection
  - Compare who won that round and add a point to the winner's score
  - Play further rounds until either the player or computer scores = 5
  - Output overall winner of the game with scores.
- Refactored the JavaScript to make DRY.
